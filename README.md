# menu

A test menue for CPUs from EKF to check them quick in the support department.

Easy reboot, powercycle, bioscheck ....


# install 

Setup for the menu add PATH and autostart in .bashrc and GUI.

use srcipt git-clone to install it on the new target. (Must be transferd to usb stick before git works. Use Zip file or ...)

# Attention

This Version is only good for me if we want to use it more general we must clean up an test and check more.

Also use without menu folder direkt in the home folder may be more clear and more easy?
